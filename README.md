# send-to-bambu-connect
If youâ€™re usingÂ **Orca Slicer**Â with the newerÂ **Bambu Connect**Â ecosystem, youâ€™ve probably noticed that sliced files donâ€™t auto-load into Connect anymore. Instead, youâ€™re expected to export theÂ .3mfÂ and manually drag it into the Bambu Connect app before printing. ðŸ˜’

I found that a bit clunky, so I wrote a smallÂ **post-processing script**Â that launches Bambu Connect automatically with the sliced file ready to go â€” no extra clicking or dragging. Here is my **MacOS script,** make sure python is installed.`dfg`

In Orca Slicerâ€“> Process Panel â€“> Others-> Post-processing scripts:

    /Users/your-path-to-script/send-to-bambu.shÂ "$OUTPUT_FILE"

Make it exicutible

    chmod +x /Users/your-path-to-script/send-to-bambu.sh

Slice model and Bambu Connect should open automatically.
